What can you build with 600 lines of code? That is the [question posed by Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001043.html) over at CodingHorror.com (originally mentioned at [JCooney.net](http://jcooney.net/post/2007/08/15/Could-you-go-live-with-less-than-600-lines-of-code.aspx)). His post highlights how [37Signals](http://37signals.com) built [Ta-Da List](http://tadalist.com), a simple online task list with only 579 lines of Ruby code.

> You read that right, not 60K or 600K but instead a commercial project in &lt; 600 lines of Ruby code.

I would agree that the amount of code may not be the best measure of success, however lines of code is a fairly reliable indication of complexity. The fact that a production ready application can be built with such a _lack of complexity_ speaks volumes to the power and simplicity of [Ruby and Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). The ability to rapidly go from idea to production is the reason Ruby on Rails is a popular choice among web startups and entrepreneurs. Ruby on Rails is designed to abstract the developer from the mundane work and allow them to focus on what actually matters: building a product.

Thanks Jeff for pointing out a real world example of a minimalistic "KISS" approach to building a product.
